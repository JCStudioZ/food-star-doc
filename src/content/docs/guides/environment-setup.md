This page will help you install and build the Food Star React Native app.

### NodeJS
Make sure you have a recent version (8.11 or later) of [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed globally. We recommend installing Node and Watchman using Homebrew. Run the following commands in a Terminal after installing Homebrew: brew install node brew install watchman If you have already installed Node on your system, make sure it is Node 8.3 or newer. Watchman is a tool by Facebook for watching changes in the filesystem. It is highly recommended you install it for better performance.

### Yarn
It is recommended to install Yarn through the npm package manager, which comes bundled with Node.js when you install it on your system.
Once you have npm installed you can run the following both to install and upgrade Yarn:
```sh
npm install --global yarn
```
### Expo CLI
Expo CLI is part of the expo package, and you can use it by leveraging npx â€” a Node.js package runner. No external installation is required.

For example, to see a list of available commands in Expo CLI, open the terminal on your development machine and run the following command:
```sh
npx expo -h
```

Now, run the following command to check which Expo account is currently authenticated on your machine:
```sh
npx expo whoami
```

If you already have an Expo account, you can log in to it by running the command:
```sh
npx expo login
```
